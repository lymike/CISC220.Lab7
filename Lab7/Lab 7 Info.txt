METHOD DECLARATIONS:
calcHash: Converts all the characters within a given string to ASCII values and sums them up, then outputs 
		  an index by modding this sum with the mapSize.
		  
calcHash2: Converts the first 3 characters within a given string to base-29 integers and multiply each by 
		   their ASCII value. Sum up these integers and mod it with the mapSize. (Ex. calcHash2("abcd") == 
		   29^0*97 + 29^1*98 + 29^3*99)
		   
collHash1: Hash the given keyword to an index. If the index is filled, move to the next slot. Continue this 
		   process until there is an empty slot or the given keyword matches the one that is already in the 
		   slot. If it reaches the end of the array, loop back to the beginning of the loop. (Linear Probing)
		   
collHash2: Hash the given keyword to an index of h+t^2, where t starts with 0 and increment by 1 if the slot 
		   of the index is filled. Similar to Linear Probing, continue the process until there is an empty 
		   slot of the given keyword matches the one that is already in the slot. (Ex. If h+0^2 is filled, 
		   then move on to h+1^2, then h+2^2, then h+3^2, etc) (Quadradic Probing)

FAVORITE PHRASES:
Today is on you know, up the ship, and the trees have no fear of the South!

But I'm sending them run for the cake!

And deep enough you like to get mighty King Yertle.

There's no birds as they can't let them away.

I'm king, and you like them with great Grinchy trick!

Games you dare to get out of them out!
